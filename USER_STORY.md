## Core User Needs (Phase 1)
- **As a board gamer who dislikes reading long manuals**, I want to see a summarized confirmation of the rules, so that I can start playing immediately.
- **As an imported board game enthusiast**, I want to get a Japanese summary of English rules, so that I can play games that don't have a Japanese version.
- **As a player in the middle of a game**, I want to quickly check specific rules or card effects, so that the game flow isn't interrupted.

- **As a frequent user**, I want to log in with my Google account, so that I can save my preferences and game lists.
- **As a collector**, I want to mark games as "Owned", "Wishlist", or "Played", so that I can manage my collection and share it with friends.
- **As a user**, I want to "Like" specific game pages, so that I can easily access them later.

## Advanced AI features (Phase 4: Future)
- **As a curious player**, I want to ask the AI specific questions about rules (e.g., "Can I use this card when I have 0 cards?"), so that I can resolve edge cases without searching through the entire rulebook.
- **As a user looking for new games**, I want personalized recommendations based on games I like (e.g., "If you like Catan, try this"), so that I can discover new favorites.

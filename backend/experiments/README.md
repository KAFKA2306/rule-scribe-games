# Experiments Directory

This directory contains experimental code, prototypes, and research scripts.
**Code in this directory is NOT part of the production Core application.**

## Rules
1.  **Isolation**: Do not import code from here into `backend/app/`.
2.  **Freedom**: You can use any libraries (CrewAI, LangChain, etc.) here.
3.  **Direct Access**: Scripts here can access Supabase directly.
4.  **Promotion**: Only promote features to Core after they are proven valuable and stable.

## Contents
*   `crew_agentic_demo.py`: Placeholder for CrewAI experiments.

# Content Guidelines: Focus on First-Time Players

This project is built for people who have **never played the game before**. Our goal is to lower the hurdle to entry and make board games accessible.

## The Grandmother Rule
> Can you explain this rule so that your grandmother (who only knows Go Fish) understands it?

If the answer is No, rewrite it.

## Jargon to Avoid (or Explain)

| Jargon | Instead Use / Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Drafting** (ドラフト) | "カードを選んで回す", "手札を選び合う" |
| **Trick-taking** (トリックテイキング) | "ミニゲームの勝ち抜き戦", "数字比べ" |
| **Worker Placement** (ワーカープレイスメント) | "駒を置いて場所取りをする" |
| **Victory Points / VP** (勝利点) | "点数", "得点" |
| **Meeple** (ミープル) | "人型コマ", "自分のコマ" |
| **Hand** (ハンド) | "手札" |
| **Deck** (デック/山札) | "山札" |

## Tone and Style

1. **Polite and Encouraging**: Use "Desu/Masu" style. Be friendly.
2. **Focus on "Why Fun"**: Don't just list mechanics. Explain *why* it feels good to play.
3. **Visual Language**: Use emojis sparsely but effectively to break up text 🎲.
4. **Short Sentences**: Keep sentences under 60 characters where possible.

## Structure Best Practices

- **Setup**: Be extremely specific. "Place the board in the center" is better than "Set up the board".
- **Turn Structure**: "On your turn, do A, then B." Clear chronological order.
- **Beginner Tips**: Don't give "Winning Strategies" that require deep knowledge. Give "Survival Tips" to help them not feel lost.

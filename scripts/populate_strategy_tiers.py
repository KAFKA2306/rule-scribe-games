ARK_NOVA_STRATEGY = """# 🦁 Ark Nova Map Tier List & Strategy (2024 Meta)

## 🗺️ Map Tier List
Based on community consensus and BGA usage stats.

### **S-Tier (Top Competitive)**
- **Map 4: Commercial Harbor**: The flexibility to sell cards and the 4-card draw capability makes this a powerhouse for cycling decks and finding key animals early.
- **Map 1: Observation Tower (BGA Alt)**: The alternative layout buffs this map significantly, offering great placement bonuses and flexibility.

### **A-Tier (Strong)**
- **Map 2: Outdoor Areas**: Excellent for large animal strategies. Early partnership access is key.
- **Map 6: Research Institute**: Ignoring conditions for playing animals allows for explosive starts, though the new BGA version adds blockers.

### **B-Tier (Balanced)**
- **Map 3: Silver Lake**: A solid map, though the recent BGA alternative version nerfed it by moving the lake. Still good for digging with "Determination".

## 🧠 Strategic Tips
- **Tempo is King**: Don't just build a zoo; race for the break. Triggering breaks when opponents are low on money or full of cards is a key disruption tactic.
- **Conservation First**: Prioritize Base Conservation Projects. Unlocking your second worker early is often better than a small appeal boost.

TM_STRATEGY = """# 🚀 Terraforming Mars Corporation Tier List (2024)

## 🏢 Corporation Tier List
Assuming all expansions (Prelude, Colonies, Turmoil).

### **S-Tier (God Tier)**
- **Point Luna**: Access to Earth tags and card draw (Titan) makes this arguably the highest ceiling corp in the game.
- **Credicor**: The economy king. 4 MC rebate on all expensive projects allows for massive efficiency engines.
- **Manutech**: With Preludes, this corporation can explode on turn 1, converting immediate production into resources.

### **A-Tier (Competitive)**
- **Tharsis Republic**: Dominant on the Tharsis map. City-building engines win ground games.
- **Saturn Systems**: Jovian tag multipliers are the strongest late-game scoring mechanic.
- **Vitor**: Awards for funding awards? Yes. Victory points for playing events? Double yes.

### **B-Tier (Situational)**
- **Ecoline**: Great for terraforming rushing, but vulnerable to plant-killing asteroids.
- **Thorgate**: Reliable Power strategy, but often lacks the explosive scoring of others.

## 🧠 Strategic Tips
- **Terraform Early**: Don't overbuild engines in Gen 8+. If you have the lead, push the parameters to end the game.
- **Milestones are Trap or Treasure**: Assess if 8 MC for 5 VP is worth it. Usually yes, but not if it stalls your engine by a generation.
"""

SCYTHE_STRATEGY = """# 🚜 Scythe Faction & Mat Tier List

## ⚔️ Combination Tier List (Competitive Rules)
Standard listing based on potential turn count to win.

### **S-Tier (Banned in some tournaments)**
- **Rusviet Union + Industrial**: The infamous "Rusviet Industrial" combo. Can end games in 12-14 turns. relentless production and movement.
- **Crimea Khanate + Patriotic**: Insane resource generation flexibility.

### **A-Tier (Top Contenders)**
- **Crimea Khanate + Industrial/innovative**: Still extremely powerful due to the Coercion ability (combat cards as resources).
- **Saxony Empire + Innovative**: An aggressive, objective-rushing powerhouse. Unlimited stars from combat mean you control the game pace.

### **B-Tier (Solid)**
- **Polania Republic + Innovative**: Mobility meets cheaper upgrades. Good for encounter-heavy playstyles.
- **Nordic Kingdoms + Engineering**: Specific strategies involving workers and seaworthy can be surprisingly fast.

## 🧠 Strategic Tips
- **Movement Upgrade**: Speed is life. prioritizing the Move upgrade is essential for almost every faction.
- **Bottom Actions**: Scythe is an engine builder. Always try to align your Top Action with a useful Bottom Action.

ISTANBUL_STRATEGY = """# 🕌 Istanbul Strategy Guide

## 💎 General Strategy
Istanbul is a race. Efficiency of movement is everything.

### **Key Tactics**
1.  **The Fountain Loop**: Plan your routes in loops that bring you back to the Fountain (central tile) to recall assistants. A strict back-and-forth is inefficient.
2.  **Wainwright Rush**: Expanding your wheelbarrow early (to max size) grants a Ruby and makes all future goods collection massive. This is a common opening gambit.
3.  **Mosque Tiles**:
    - **Red/Yellow Mosques**: Getting the "Fifth Assistant" tile early is a game momentum changer.
    - **Blue Mosque**: The extra movement die can be useful, but is often less consistent than the extra assistant.

## 🎲 Dice Game / Variants Tips
- **Dice Game**: Prioritize **Mosque Tiles** over single Rubies in the early game. The passive income or extra dice pay off huge dividends in later rounds.
- **Choose & Write**: Watch your opponents! If an opponent chooses an action that benefits you (e.g., "All players gain 1 Good"), position yourself to maximize it without spending your own turn.
